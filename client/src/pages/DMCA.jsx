          mangaswipe.com respects the intellectual property of others.
          mangaswipe.com takes matters of Intellectual property very seriously
          and is committed to meeting the needs of content owners while helping
          them manage the publication of their content online. The books’ files,
          which are under copyright protection, are NOT PUBLISHED on the
          website. We are not supporting digital piracy. Our task is to make the
          users familiar with the world literature novelties and to retain
          copyright. The books’ fragments on our website are added by users, for
          the enjoyment of other users and not for the purpose of commercial
          benefit. We have no opportunity to control them constantly; thus, if
          you consider that some fragments violate the author’s right, contact
          us. If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a way
          that constitutes copyright infringement and is accessible on this
          site, you may notify our copyright agent, as set forth in the Digital
          Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). For your complaint to be
          valid under the DMCA, you must provide the following information when
          providing notice of the claimed copyright infringement: A physical or
          electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the
          copyright owner Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have
          been infringed Identification of the material that is claimed to be
          infringing or to be the subject of the infringing activity and that is
          to be removed. We will not accept links to only search results, as
          they do not identify any item that may link to material infringing
          your work and copyright. You must identify individual items in the
          search results that you wish us to remove. If you send a link to
          another page, please describe which materials are under copyright
          protection. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service
          provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address,
          telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address. A
          statement that the complaining party “in good faith believes that use
          of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
          copyright owner, its agent, or law” A statement that the “information
          in the notification is accurate”, and “under penalty of perjury, the
          complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
          exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.” The above information
          must be submitted as a written, faxed, or emailed notification.
